# ⚙️ Setup Instructions for ELIANA.py Script

Before running the script, you need to update the Telegram credentials inside the script to enable communication with your Telegram Bot.

---

### Step 1: Create Your Telegram Bot & Get Your User ID

To set this up, please watch these quick tutorial videos:

### Step 2: Edit the Script with Your Credentials

Once you have your **Telegram User ID** and **Bot API Token**, open the `ELIANA.ps1` script and find the following lines:

```python
$telegram_id, $api_token = "your_user_id_here", "your_api_token_here"
```

Replace `"your_user_id_here"` with your Telegram User ID, and `"your_api_token_here"` with your Bot’s API token.

---

### Step 3: Run the Script to Generate Required Files

Run the script `ELIANA.py`. It will automatically create the necessary `.bat` and `.vbs` files for you.

---

### Step 4: Session Interaction

When you run the Python script, it will prompt you to enter a **session ID**. This allows you to interact with different sessions if needed.

* You can press **Enter** to accept the default session ID `99999`, or
* Enter your own session ID as per your preference or script requirements.

### Step 5: Running the Generated Files

After the `.bat` and `.vbs` files are created, run them as needed to start the tool’s functionalities.

# ✍🏼 About Author

I'm Dodin Mel-Adrien also known as Kidpentester/Adrilaw built this as an intern , to demonstrate the use of telegram to gain access to a windows machine without being detected by antivirus software , this tool was explicitly designed for vulnerability assesment and penetration testing . My inspiration to build this came from my wife , she inspired me in a way I can’t fully describe. Her strength, beauty, and resilience showed me what it means to keep moving forward no matter what stands in the way. Watching how she never let anything break her spirit made me want to push myself harder, to build things, to improve my skills, and to create tools that help me grow in my cybersecurity journey. Her character reminded me that when someone is strong and unstoppable, you feel motivated to chase your goals with the same energy.
